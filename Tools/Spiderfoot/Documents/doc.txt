   What is SpiderFoot?
------------------------
SpiderFoot is an OSINT automation tool that collects information from public sources about a target, such as domains and IP addresses. It streamlines reconnaissance by automating data gathering on various entities, aiding in security assessments. The tool provides insights into potential threats and vulnerabilities through comprehensive information analysis. SpiderFoot is widely used in cybersecurity for reconnaissance and intelligence gathering.

      How to use?
------------------------
spiderfoot -h
usage: sf.py [-h] [-d] [-l IP:port] [-m mod1,mod2,...] [-M] [-C scanID] [-s TARGET] [-t type1,type2,...] [-u {all,footprint,investigate,passive}] [-T] [-o {tab,csv,json}] [-H] [-n] [-r] [-S LENGTH] [-D DELIMITER] [-f]
             [-F type1,type2,...] [-x] [-q] [-V] [-max-threads MAX_THREADS]

SpiderFoot 4.0.0: Open Source Intelligence Automation.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug           Enable debug output.
  -l IP:port            IP and port to listen on.
  -m mod1,mod2,...      Modules to enable.
  -M, --modules         List available modules.
  -C scanID, --correlate scanID
                        Run correlation rules against a scan ID.
  -s TARGET             Target for the scan.
  -t type1,type2,...    Event types to collect (modules selected automatically).
  -u {all,footprint,investigate,passive}
                        Select modules automatically by use case
  -T, --types           List available event types.
  -o {tab,csv,json}     Output format. Tab is default.
  -H                    Don't print field headers, just data.
  -n                    Strip newlines from data.
  -r                    Include the source data field in tab/csv output.
  -S LENGTH             Maximum data length to display. By default, all data is shown.
  -D DELIMITER          Delimiter to use for CSV output. Default is ,.
  -f                    Filter out other event types that weren't requested with -t.
  -F type1,type2,...    Show only a set of event types, comma-separated.
  -x                    STRICT MODE. Will only enable modules that can directly consume your target, and if -t was specified only those events will be consumed by modules. This overrides -t and -m options.
  -q                    Disable logging. This will also hide errors!
  -V, --version         Display the version of SpiderFoot and exit.
  -max-threads MAX_THREADS
                        Max number of modules to run concurrently.

 we have 4 options to san the network.


All-Get anything and everything about the target.

    All SpiderFoot modules will be enabled (slow) but every possible piece of information about the target will be obtained and analysed.

Footprint- Understand what information this target exposes to the Internet.

    Gain an understanding about the target's network perimeter, associated identities and other information that is obtained through a lot of web crawling and search engine use.

Investigate- Best for when you suspect the target to be malicious but need more information.

    Some basic footprinting will be performed in addition to querying of blacklists and other sources that may have information about your target's maliciousness.

Passive- When you don't want the target to even suspect they are being investigated.

    As much information will be gathered without touching the target or their affiliates, therefore only modules that do not touch the target will be enabled.
