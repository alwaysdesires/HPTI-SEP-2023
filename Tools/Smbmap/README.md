# SMBMap

SMBMap is a versatile tool for working with Windows networks and SMB shares. It simplifies the process of searching for potentially sensitive data across large Windows networks and provides powerful features for interacting with SMB shares.

**Key Features**:
- Pass-the-Hash Support
- File upload/download/delete
- Permission enumeration (writable share, meet Metasploit)
- Remote Command Execution
- Distributed file content searching (beta!)
- File name matching (with an auto-download capability)
- Host file parser supports IPs, host names, and CIDR

**Important Note**:
- Some features of SMBMap may still be in beta, and user feedback and bug reports are highly appreciated. This helps in improving the tool's functionality and reliability.

You can install SMBMap using the following command:
```
$ sudo pip3 install smbmap
```
I have added a manual in documents directory
